<div>
    SCM Source implementation which provides a connector to import branches and pull requests
    from Bitbucket.

    It will retrieve all branches and pull requests available at indexing time. Username and password
    credentials are needed to access Bitbucket API (Scan Credentials field), and both SSH and username/password 
    can be used for git checkout (see advanced options by clicking in the Advanced button below).

    If only "Scan Credentials" are provided they will be used for the scan process and git checkout.
